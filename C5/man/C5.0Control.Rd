Control for C5.0 Models
}
\description{
Various parameters that control aspects of the C5.0 fit.

\usage{
C5.0Control(subset = TRUE, 
            rules = FALSE, 
            bands = 0, 
            winnow = FALSE, 
            noGlobalPruning = FALSE, 
            CF = 0.25, 
            minCases = 2, 
            fuzzyThreshold = FALSE, 
            sample = 0, 
            seed = sample.int(4096, size = 1) - 1L,  
            label = "outcome")
}
\arguments{
  \item{subset}{
A logical: should the model evaluate groups of discrete predictors for splits?
}
  \item{rules}{
A logical: should the tree be decomposed into a rule-based model?
}
  \item{bands}{
An integer between 2 and 1000. If \code{TRUE}, the model orders the rules by their affect on the error rate and groups the rules into the specified number of bands. This modifies the output so that the effect on the error rate can be seen for the groups of rules within a band. If this options is selected and \code{rules = FALSE}, a warning is issued and \code{rules} is changed to \code{TRUE}.
}
  \item{winnow}{
A logical: should predictor winnowing be used?
}
  \item{noGlobalPruning}{
A logical to toggle whether the final, global pruning step to simplify the tree.
}
  \item{CF}{
A number in (0, 1) for the confidence factor.
}
  \item{minCases}{
an integer for the smallest number of samples that must be put in at least two of the splits.
}
  \item{fuzzyThreshold}{
A logical toggle to evaluate possible advanced splits of the data. See Quinlan (1993) for details and examples. 
}
  \item{sample}{
A value between (0, 99.9) that specifies the random percentage of the data should be used to train the model. By default, all the samples are used for model training. Samples not used for training are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in the printed output.
}
  \item{seed}{
An integer for the random number seed within the C code.
}
  \item{label}{
A character label for the outcome used in the output.
}
}

A list of options.
