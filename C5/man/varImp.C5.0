Variable Importance Measures for C5.0 Models
}
\description{
This function calculates the variable importance (aka attribute usage) for C5.0 models.
}
\usage{
\method{varImp}{C5.0}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
an object of class \code{C5.0}
}
  \item{\dots}{
other options (not currently used)
}
}
\details{
C5.0 measures predictor importance by determining the percentage of
training set samples that fall into all the terminal nodes after the
split. For example, the predictor in the first split automatically has
an importance measurement of 100 percent. Other predictors may be used
frequently in splits, but if the terminal nodes cover only a handful
of training set samples, the importance scores may be close to
zero. The same strategy is applied to rule-based models as well as
the corresponding boosted versions of the model. 

There is a difference in the attribute usage numbers between this output and the nominal command line output. Although the calculations are exactly the same, the C code does not display that an attribute was used if the percentage of training samples covered by the corresponding splits is very low. Here, the threshold was lowered and the fractional usage is shown.

\value{
a data frame with a column \code{Overall} with the predictor usage values. The row names indicate the predictor.
