This directory contains tmk config file for each environment.

---

The idea of this directory is the same to move from old BSD style
rc.local to SysV init.d. The file mpi-sb.mpg.de contains {Linux, IRIX,
SunOS, windows} related codes in one file. But now if someone edit the
windows related part, there should be no effect to Linux,IRIX,SunOS
part.

When new environment is added, 

1. You can edit 

	tmk/config/site/mpi-sb.mpg.de 
	tmk/config/site/mpi-sb.mpg.de_confdir/Linux.config (for Linux)

   These files are dispatcher to which file will be finally read.

2. Add a new environment file. (e.g., linux.debian2.2.config)

The file names are lowercase, because the same name to $ARCH might be
some problems in some environment. (e.g., set CVS global ignore as
IRIX*, Debian*).
