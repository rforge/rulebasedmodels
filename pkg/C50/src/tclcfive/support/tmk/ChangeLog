	* Put release version 1.0.1.

	* src/tmk, src/cmdline.tmk, src/module_config.tmk,
	config/soft/comp/gcc.tmk: Introduce `runmode' to tmk for building
	64 bit executable, switching gcc executable. 

	* translate CHANGES.LOG to ChangeLog according to CVS log.

	* There are a lot of changes so far, e.g., multi-thread (Stefan
	Brabec, Hendrik Lensch, ..), Darwin ports (Wolfgang Heidrich), and
	so forth. But I am sorry not to be able to find those information
	at CHANGES.LOG file. Please add some information in this file.

	* added ::arch_name, removed DEFAULT_ARCH 

2000-10-23 htschirm

	* added module::DEFS (c/c++ -D options)

	* set_lazy now really usable, incl. override of lazy value

	* bugs fixed: module versioning and default versions

2000-10-16 htschirm

	* bugs fixed:
	  file name normalization (x/.., /./)
	  automatic lib names (base/util///)

	* -DCOMP_ -DARCH_ now always completely uppercase

	* The last line of the .libspec files was not correct in the previous tmk 
	  release. This bug has been fixed. However, this means that you should 
	  regenerate all .libspec files to make sure (e.g. by enforcing linking 
	  with -force).

	* Added the "noprefix" option to log_msg
	
2000-08-30 htschirm 

	* new "local_only" command: declares targets as local-only, so
	that when one of these targets is specified, no subdirectory
	processing will take place

	* introduced SUBDIR_PROCESSING variable that can either be
	"bottom-up" or "top-down" or "none". In the case of top-down,
	subdirectories are processed AFTER processing the local targets,
	for bottom-up the subdirectories are built first.

	* introduced link::exe_only: commands can be 'redirected' to only
	affect the library specification for the local executables, as
	opposed to both libraries and executables. This is implemented by
	'aliasing' the linker's LIBPATH, SYSLIBS, PROJLIBS, and OPTIONS
	variables to EXE_LIBPATH, EXE_PROJLIBS, .... Here is an example of
	how to use it:
	  #---------------------------------------------------------------------
	  # this affects local lib and executables
	  module {cxx math}

	  # only the application uses qt for testing, but it's not required for
	  #   using the local lib
	  exe_only {
	    module qt
	  }
	  #---------------------------------------------------------------------

	* ===========
	  tmk-0.9beta
	  ===========
	- first public release
	- modules now live in separate namespaces
	- redesign of c, cxx, and link modules
	- can choose among multiple compilers in TMakefile
	- each compiler has separate FLAGS for each language
	- can set the linker to any language/compiler separately
	- introduced abstract meta compiler options to render
	  some things more transparent
	- introduced EXE_PROJLIBS, EXE_LIBPATH, EXE_SYSLIBS, EXE_OPTIONS 
	  to allow specifying different libraries and options for the 
	  local executables as for the local library
	- introduced tmk-based 'transitive linking' (.libspec files)

	- new documentation on 'installing and configuring tmk'
	- updated tutorial

	*==================
	before tmk-0.9beta
	==================
	- in-house use only at the 'Max-Planck-Institut fuer Informatik'
	- in use for more than one year
