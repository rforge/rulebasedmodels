README for site configuration directory.

		2004-5-19(Wed) Yamauchi Hitoshi@MPII

Here (tmk/config/site/), there are some site-config samples.
These files are used for generating ~/.tmk/cache/config-* files.

The effective files (site-config file) are:

	 /usr/lib/tmk/config/site/site-config.tmk
	 /usr/lib/tmk/config/site/${DOMAIN} 

tmk -sysinfo tells you what is the ${DOMAIN}.


1. For domain wide administrator.
--------------------------------

When you install some softwares and teach them to tmk, you might
change a site-config file.

The effect of change is to all users in the domain except one who uses
personal setting file (see the next section).


2.For personal user.
--------------------------------

You can directory change your site-config file as a domain wide
administrator does. (If you have the root password.)

Otherwise, as one usual user, you can copy the site-config file to
$HOME/.tmk/site-config/site-config.tmk . And change it.
