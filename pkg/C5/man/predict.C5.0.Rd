\title{
Predict new samples using a C5.0 model
}
\description{
This function produces predicted classes or confidence values from a C5.0 model.
}
\usage{
\method{predict}{C5.0}(object, newdata = NULL, 
        trials = object$trials["Actual"],
        type = "class", ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
an object of class \code{C5.0}
}
  \item{newdata}{
a matrix or data frame of predictors
}
  \item{trials}{an integer for how many boosting iterations are used
for prediction. See the note below.  }


  \item{type}{
either \code{"class"} for the predicted class or \code{"prob"} for model confidence values.
}
  \item{\dots}{
other options (not currently used)
}
}
\details{

Note that the number of trials in the object my be less than what was
specified originally (unless \code{earlyStopping = FALSE} was used in
\code{\link{C5.0Control}}). If the number requested is larger than the
actual number available, the maximum actual is used and a warning is
issued.

Model confidence values reflect the distribution of the classes in
terminal nodes or within rules. 

For rule-based models (i.e. not boosted), the predicted confidence
value is the confidence value from the most specific, active
rule. Note that C4.5 sorts the rules, and uses the first active rule
for prediction. However, the default in the orignla sources did not
normalize the confidence values. For examnple, for two classes it was
possible to get confidence values of (0.3815, 0.8850) or (0.0000,
0.922), which do not add to one. For rules, this code divides the
values by there sum. The previous values would be converted to
(0.3012, 0.6988) and (0, 1). There are also cases where no rule is
activated. Here, equal values are assinged to each class.

For boosting, the per-class confidence values are aggregated over all
of the trees created during the boosting process and these aggregate
values are normalized so that the overall per-class confidence values
sum to one.

\value{
when \code{type = "class"}, a factor vector is returned. When \code{type = "prob"}, a matrix of confidence values is returned (one column per class).
